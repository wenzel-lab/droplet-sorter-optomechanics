# Open Soure Hardware Optics and Mechanics Design for Fluorescence Activated (Microfluidic) Droplet Sorting (FADS) [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

It in cludes the design of positioning, lasers, filters, detectors, fixtures for open droplet sorting. Note that the design in this repository is quite different to literatures designs. The set-up has been re-designed in order to make it more low-cost (estimated parts cost 20.000 USD, mainly for optical filters, detectors and laser) and open source, including hardware, software and accessible fabrication of parts where possible. Also, a number of updates and improvements have been made over the current state-of the art of droplet sorters, inspired by technical advances in the related field of flow-cytometry.

* The open source FPGA controll is documented seperately: https://github.com/MakerTobey/Open_FADS_FPGA_control
* The microfluidic chip is positioned with an [open source SQUID microscopy stage](https://github.com/wenzel-lab/squid-motorized-stage).
* And the otptical detection arm assembly is based on the [Open-UC2 3d printed optics cubes](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT).
* The modified and new Open-UC2 compatible cubes can be found in the STL folder of this repository, and all modifyable design files are openly availble in the cloud [here on OnShape](https://tinyurl.com/WenzelLabUC2), where you can view, export and copy (to modify) the project designs.
